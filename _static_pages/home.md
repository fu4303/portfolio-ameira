tagline: ['copywriter', 'actor', 'creative']
excerpt: "In a stage musical, the set and choreography are designed to support the songs, whereas film musicals are created in such a way that could be seen to deem the songs as the support act and the visual spectacle as the front liner."

I have been a tour guide, a terrible waitress and a children’s party entertainer. I went to university in Bristol, a hub for the arts, and was a member of an improvised
comedy variety show called The Bish Bosh Bash. We once improvised a musical about courgettes falling in love, a true highlight in my improvising career.

I am a trained actress and writer. My passion lies with the arts, so I always add a creative flair to everything I do. Having written short stories, reviews, blog posts, plays and poems, I thrive when embracing a challenge.
