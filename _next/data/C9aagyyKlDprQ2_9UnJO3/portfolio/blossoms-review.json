Their latest track transports you straight to summer with its chill vibes and calming tone. Blossoms called upon Liam Fray (lead singer of The Courteeners) to accompany them with a cover of his 2008 track ‘Please Don’t’.</p>\n<p>The original ‘Please Don’t’ included rattling snare drums and staccato guitar strums, but Blossoms have stripped the tune right back to its core. Together, Blossoms and Fray have created a far more mature sound. The harmonies between Fray and Tom Ogden add a whole new layer to the song that evolves from the original. The stop-start invective in the lyrics is less jarring in this cover, most likely due to Ogden’s smoky tone. The trickle of the piano, rhythmic guitar riffs, whisper-like singing, and steady drumbeats all blend seamlessly together, marrying the best of Liam Fray and Blossoms.</p>\n<p>‘Please Don’t (In Isolation)’ is not the most unique track around, but it is undeniably catchy, and we will undoubtedly have it on repeat all summer.</p>\n<iframe style=\"margin: 0 auto\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jKMGnAx1ro\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","image":"blossoms.jpg","description":"A commission for Only A Northern One.","tags":["review"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
